When I was studying for the GRE I found abundant resources for practicing the math and verbal reasoning sections, and plenty of good guides on conducting the essay writing section. What I did not find, however, was an environment to practice in. Given that the software's look-and-feel on test-day is well publicized, and that a comprehensive list of essay topics is available, [https://getglib.com](getglib.com) was my attempt to replicate the test experience, in the browser, to give an accurate way to practice.

I have not updated the code since I needed it, and while it continues to run for now, I created this repository for posterity. If you feel so inclined, feel free to fork the repo, and make updates/changes. I am happy to add other's features to the site itself!
